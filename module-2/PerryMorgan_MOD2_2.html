      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>

      <p class="intro">My journey into the world of software development has been anything but linear, with a path that
        includes significant time in both law enforcement and the Navy before I found my calling in technology. These
        experiences, while seemingly unrelated to coding, taught me a great deal about structure, discipline, and
        problem-solving under pressure. Ultimately, that foundation proved to be the perfect, if unconventional,
        launchpad for a career focused on building logical and efficient digital solutions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Professionally, I currently work as a Senior IT Project Specialist at
        Tyson Foods, where I'm a part of the exciting emerging technology and AI
        team. My role is centered on full-stack development, which allows me to
        work on projects from the ground up and see them through to completion.
        <span class="sentence">I recently led a project to build an enterprise-wide AI assistant for
          our HR department, a tool designed to serve around 19,000 users.</span>
      </p>

      <p>
        My primary focus is on full-stack development, and I'm most comfortable
        working with languages like Python, Vue, and JavaScript. I'm always
        looking to expand my skillset, and I've recently started diving into
        TypeScript and React to keep up with modern development trends. Outside
        of the command line, I have a creative side that I nurture through
        writing and painting, which provides a great balance to the technical
        aspects of my work.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not immersed in my studies or professional projects, my life is
        happily managed by my 20-year-old daughter and my incredibly energetic
        6-year-old son. They are my primary motivation and the biggest reason
        I've pushed myself to build a career in a field I'm passionate about.
        Balancing a demanding career, my education, and family life is a
        constant juggling act, but it's one that I find immensely fulfilling.
